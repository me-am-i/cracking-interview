/*
  Let's take a look at some sequence and result:
  0000000000 (10 lockers)
  after 10 toggles:
  1001000010

  We see locks are opened on places, which index is square.
  Let's double check it for each number: how many delimiters it has.

  All things considered, that the number of open locks are N ^ (1 / 2) = 10 locks (for N = 100)
