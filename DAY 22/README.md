## DAY 22. Sorting and Searching

List of tasks:

- [Search in Rotated Array](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2022/SearchInRotatedArray.java)  
  *Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: find 5 in { 15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14 }  
  Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)*  

- [Sorted Search, No Size](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2022/SortedSearch.java)  
  *You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in 0(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index*
