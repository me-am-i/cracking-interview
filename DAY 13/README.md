## DAY 13. Math and Logic Puzzles

List of tasks:

- [Blue-Eyed Island](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2013/BlueEyedIsland.java)  
  *A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?*  

- [The Apocalypse](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2013/TheApocalypse.java)  
  *In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this policy—that is, they have continue to have children until they have one girl, at which point they immediately stop—what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.*  

- [The Egg Drop Problem](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2013/TheEggDropProblem.java)  
  *There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.*
