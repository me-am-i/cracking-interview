## DAY 29. Moderate

List of tasks:

- [Number Swapper](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2029/NumberSwapper.java)  
  *Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables).*  

- [Word Frequencies](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2029/WordFrequencies.java)  
  *Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?*  

- [Smallest Difference](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2029/SmallestDifference.java)  
  *Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: {1,3,15,11,2}, {23,127,235,19,8}  
  Output 3. That is, the pair (11,8).*  

- [Number Max](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2029/NumberMax.java)  
  *Write a method that finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if/else or any other comparison operator.*
