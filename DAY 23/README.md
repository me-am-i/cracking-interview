## DAY 23. Sorting and Searching

List of tasks:

- [Sparse Search](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2023/SparseSearch.java)  
  *Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.*  

- [Missing Int](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2023/MissingInt.java)  
  *Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.*  

- [Find Duplicates](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2023/FindDuplicates.java)  
  *You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?*
