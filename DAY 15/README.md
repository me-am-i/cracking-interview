## DAY 15. Object-Oriented design

List of tasks:

- [Deck of Cards](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2015/DeckOfCards.java)  
  *Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.*  

- [Minesweeper](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2015/Minesweeper.java)  
  *Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the classic single-player computer game where an NxN grid has 8 mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid. The remaining ceils are either blank or have a number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding eight ceils. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses. If it is a number, the number is exposed. !f it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and including the surrounding numeric celts) are exposed. The player wins when all non-bomb celts are exposed. The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb. (Tip for the reader: if you're not familiar with this game, please play a few rounds online first.)*
