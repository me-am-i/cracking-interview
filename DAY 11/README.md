## DAY 11. Bit Manipulation

List of tasks:

- [Pairwise Swap](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2011/PairwiseSwap.java)  
  *Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).*  

- [Draw Line](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2011/DrawLine.java)  
  *A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte.The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y). The method signature should look something like: `drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1 , int x2, int y)`*
