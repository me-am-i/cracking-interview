## DAY 16. Recursion and Dynamic Programming

List of tasks:

- [Triple Step](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2016/TripleStep.java)  
  *A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.*  

- [Robot in a Grid](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2016/RobotInGrid.java)  
  *Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.*  

- [Magic Index](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2016/MagicIndex.java)  
  *A magic index in an array A [1 ... n-1] is defined to bean index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.*
