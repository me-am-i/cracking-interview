## DAY 30. Moderate

List of tasks:

- [Sub Sort](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2030/SubSort.java)  
  *Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest such sequence).*  

- [Contiguous Sequence](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2030/ContiguousSequence.java)  
  *You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.*  

- [Pond Sizes](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2030/PondSizes.java)  
  *You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.*  

- [Sum Swap](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2030/SumSwap.java)  
  *Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.*  

- [Pairs with Sum](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2030/PairsWithSum.java)  
  *Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.*
