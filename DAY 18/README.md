  *Write a method to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters.*  

- [Parens](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2018/Parens.java)  
  *Implement an algorithm to print all valid (i.e., properly opened and closed) combinations of n pairs of parentheses.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: 3  
  Output: ((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()()*  

- [Paint Fill](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%2018/PaintFill.java)
